This will make it faster and more efficient.\n\n**The Why:** This change improves code performance and follows Python best practices.\n\n**Suggested Improvement:**\n```python\n# Refactored version would go here\n```\n\n---\n\n### Comment 2\n\n**Original Feedback:** \"No exit condition.\"\n\n**Positive Rephrasing:** Good foundation in place! Consider this enhancement: Nice work! To make future changes easier, let's refactoring this section for improved maintainability and clarity. This will help the codebase evolve smoothly.\n\n**The Why:** This change improves code maintainability and follows Python best practices.\n\n**Suggested Improvement:**\n```python\n# Refactored version would go here\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- **Total Comments Processed:** 2\n- **Comments Needing Empathy:** 2\n- **AI-Enhanced:** No (Traditional ML)\n\n## Key Improvements Identified\n- **Performance** improvements suggested\n- **Maintainability** improvements suggested\n\n*Remember: Every piece of feedback is an opportunity to grow and learn.
